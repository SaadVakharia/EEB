                    <h3>Steps Government Should Take to Encourage Women Entrepreneurs:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Financial Support:</strong> Provide subsidized loans, grants, and credit facilities through schemes like MUDRA (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency), Stand-Up India, and specialized women entrepreneurship funds with lower interest rates and relaxed collateral requirements.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Skill Development Programs:</strong> Organize training workshops, capacity-building programs, and entrepreneurship development programs (EDPs) to enhance business management, technical, and leadership skills among aspiring women entrepreneurs.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Simplified Registration Process:</strong> Streamline business registration, licensing procedures, and reduce bureaucratic hurdles. Offer single-window clearance systems and online registration facilities to save time and effort.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Support:</strong> Establish dedicated women's industrial parks, technology incubation centers, and co-working spaces with essential amenities and networking opportunities.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Marketing and Networking:</strong> Create platforms for product exhibitions, trade fairs, and buyer-seller meets. Facilitate access to domestic and international markets through e-commerce platforms and export promotion councils.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Legal Protection:</strong> Implement and enforce laws against gender discrimination, ensure property rights, and provide legal aid for business-related matters.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Reservation and Procurement:</strong> Reserve a certain percentage of government procurement for women-owned enterprises and offer preferential treatment in tenders and contracts.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <div class="key-point">

                        Acquisition vs Merger (with Examples) 
                        <span class="marks-badge">5 MARKS</span>
                        <span class="frequency">4 Times</span>
                        <span class="word-count">~250 words</span>
                    </h2>
                    
                    <h3>Acquisition:</h3>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Acquisition</span> is a corporate strategy where one company (acquirer) purchases most or all of another company's (target) shares or assets to gain control. The acquiring company maintains its identity while the acquired company may cease to exist independently or operate as a subsidiary.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. WhatsApp continued to operate as a separate entity under Facebook's ownership (now Meta). Similarly, Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart in India for $16 billion in 2018.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Merger:</h3>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Merger</span> is a mutual agreement between two companies to combine their operations and form a new legal entity. Both companies dissolve their individual identities to create a unified organization with shared ownership, management, and resources.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in 2018 to form Vodafone Idea Limited (Vi). Both companies combined their assets and operations to create India's largest telecom operator at that time.</p>
